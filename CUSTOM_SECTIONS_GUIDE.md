### 2. **Order Matters**
The sections appear in the order you add them. Add the most important ones first.

### 3. **Keep It Concise**
Each item should be brief and impactful. Use bullet points for multiple achievements.

### 4. **Use Consistent Formatting**
Maintain the same format across all items in a section.

### 5. **Quantify When Possible**
Include numbers, percentages, and metrics to show impact.

### 6. **Be Specific**
Include dates, organizations, and specific details.

### 7. **Proofread**
Check spelling and grammar in custom sections carefully.

## When to Use Custom Sections

### ✅ Use Custom Sections When:
- You have certifications relevant to the job
- You've received notable awards or recognition
- You have publications or speaking engagements
- You speak multiple languages (especially for international roles)
- You have volunteer work that demonstrates relevant skills
- You have patents or research experience
- You're a member of professional organizations

### ❌ Avoid Custom Sections When:
- The information is already covered in other sections
- The section would only have 1-2 weak items
- The information isn't relevant to the job
- It would make your resume too long (keep it to 1-2 pages)
