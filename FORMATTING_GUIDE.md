# Work Experience Formatting Guide

The Work Experience section now includes a rich text editor with formatting capabilities that render perfectly in the PDF output.

## Available Formatting Options

### 1. **Bold Text**
- **In Editor**: Click the **B** button or wrap text with `**text**`
- **Example**: `**Led a team of 5 developers**`
- **PDF Output**: Text appears in bold font

### 2. **Italic Text**
- **In Editor**: Click the *I* button or wrap text with `*text*`
- **Example**: `*Improved performance by 40%*`
- **PDF Output**: Text appears in italic font

### 3. **Bullet Points**
- **In Editor**: Click the bullet list button or start line with `•`, `-`, or `*`
- **Example**: 
  ```
  • Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js
  • Implemented authentication with JWT
  ```
- **PDF Output**: Properly indented bullet points

### 4. **Numbered Lists**
- **In Editor**: Click the numbered list button or start line with `1.`, `2.`, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```
  1. Analyzed requirements and created technical specifications
  2. Designed database schema and API endpoints
  3. Implemented features and wrote unit tests
  ```
- **PDF Output**: Numbered list with proper indentation

## Combining Formats

You can combine bold and italic within bullet points and numbered lists:

```
• **Architected** and implemented a *microservices-based* system
• Reduced deployment time by **50%** using *CI/CD pipelines*
1. **Phase 1**: Requirements gathering and *stakeholder interviews*
2. **Phase 2**: Design and prototyping
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use the toolbar buttons** - They automatically insert the correct syntax
2. **Select text first** - Highlight text before clicking Bold/Italic to wrap it
3. **Mix formats freely** - Combine bullets, numbering, bold, and italic as needed
4. **Preview before download** - Always check the PDF preview to ensure formatting looks correct
5. **Keep it professional** - Don't overuse formatting; use it to highlight key achievements

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While there are no keyboard shortcuts, you can type the markdown syntax directly:
- `**text**` for bold
- `*text*` for italic
- Start line with `•` or `-` for bullets
- Start line with `1.` for numbered lists
